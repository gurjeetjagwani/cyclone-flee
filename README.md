<h1> Cyclone Flee </h1>
Agent based simulation for hurricane/cyclone - induced migration using FLEE simulation toolkit.

<h3> Purpose </h3>

Cyclones and Hurricanes are responsible for displacing large number of people into secure shelters and evacuation centers(ECs).
Predicting this displacement with a simulation can help authorities prepare resources needed for shelters and ECs to assist the displaced individuals.

<h3> Approach </h3>

The simulation toolkit FLEE (primarily used for predicting refugee displacement) is redesigned to suit displacment caused by cyclones/hurricanes.
