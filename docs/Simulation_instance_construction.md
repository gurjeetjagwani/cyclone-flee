# **Simulation instance construction**

This documentation details how to construct a conflict scenario for forced displacement simulation. Each conflict situation requires input data (in `input_csv` directory), validation data (in `source_data` directory) and execution scripts (`run.py`, `run_par.py` and `simsetting.csv`) as illustrated below:

</p>


To create input and validation data files, the following forced displacement databases are considered:



* the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED, [https://www.acleddata.com/data](https://www.acleddata.com/data));
* the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees database (UNHCR, [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations));
* the population databases (e.g. <https://www.citypopulation.de>);
* the geospatial databases (e.g. <https://www.openstreetmap.org>)  or [http://www.bing.com/maps](http://www.bing.com/maps)).

## **Construct an input locations.csv file**

### **ACLED conflict locations extraction**

The ACLED database provides conflict location data for forced displacement simulations. To obtain data on chosen conflict situation, complete the ACLED data export tool fields ([https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/data-export-tool/](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/data-export-tool/)) as follows:


* Provide dates of interest for conflict situation (i.e. From and To).
* Select `Event Type: Battle`.
* Select `Sub Event Type`
	* Armed clash,
	* Attack,
	* Government regains territory and
	* Non-state actor overtakes territory.
* Specify `Region` and `Country` of conflict situation choice.
* Click on Export and Accept Terms of Use and Attribution Policy.
* Click Export again and `<name>.csv` file exports to Downloads automatically.


The ACLED conflict data provides conflict locations to construct **`locations.csv`** input file for simulation purposes. After identifying conflict locations and producing **`locations.csv`**, the last column is filled with population data for conflict locations.


| **name** | **region** | **country** | **lat** | **long** | **location_type** | **conflict_date** | **population/capacity** |
|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|   A  |   AA   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
|   B  |   BB   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
|   C  |   CC   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
| ...  |  ...   |   ...   | ... |  ... |       ...     |      ...      |         ...         |


### **UNHCR forced migrant counts and camp locations extraction**

The UNHCR situations provides an overview of active situations worldwide that are facing forced displacement distress. To construct a new conflict situation:



* Select an active (conflict) situation of interest from an interactive map and click to access data and documentation relevant to a chosen conflict situation from [https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations).

* Select a simulation period for conflict situation from `Refugees and asylum-seekers from 'chosen situation name' - Total timeline`, which also presents forced displacement counts for a chosen period.

* Obtain total counts of forcibly displaced people by clicking JSON button of `Refugees and asylum-seekers from 'chosen situation name' - Total section`.

* Identify camps for each neighbouring country through `Breakdown by Country` section of the conflict situation.

* Collect and save data for each camp (e.g. `<country_name-camp_name>.csv`).


Input camp names (i.e. destination locations) and their capacity into **`locations.csv`** file. Camp capacity is the highest number of forced migrants for each camp and obtained from individual camp CSV files that are set in **`locations.csv`**. For instance, `CampZ.csv` has the highest number of forcibly displaced people (18129) on 2015-09-30, which is the camp capacity for CampZ.


|     ...      |   ...   |
|:------------:|:-------:|
|  2015-03-31  |  11470  |
|  2015-06-02  |  12405  |
|  2015-07-24  |  12405  |
|  2015-08-31  |  11359  |
|  2015-09-30  |  18129  |
|     ...      |   ...   |


### **Population data extraction**

Currently, the population figures for each location will need to be collected and written to the *population/capacity* column from <www.citypopulation.de>. After the population data has been collected for each location, input these population numbers in `locations.csv`, which can be then used for simulation execution.


## **Construct an input routes.csv file**

Identified conflict zones and camps provide origin and destination locations. We connect these locations to represent how forcibly displaced people flee. We use [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) or [http://www.bing.com/maps](http://www.bing.com/maps) (or other mapping services) to connect conflict zones and camps, and add additional locations (if required) as a location type **town** to **`locations.csv`** as illustrated below:


| **name** | **region** | **country** | **lat** | **long** | **location_type** | **conflict_date** | **population/capacity** |
|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
|   A  |   AA   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
|   B  |   BB   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
|   C  |   CC   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |    conflict   |      xxx      |         xxx         |
|   Z  |   ZZ   |   ZZZ   | xxx |  xxx |      camp     |               |         xxx         |
|   N  |   NN   |   ABC   | xxx |  xxx |      town     |               |                     |
| ...  |  ...   |   ...   | ... |  ... |       ...     |      ...      |         ...         |

Record distances between locations in **`routes.csv`** file for simulation using the following format:

| **name1** | **name2** | **distance[km]** | **forced_redirection** |
|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:---:|
| A    |   B    |   x1    |     |
| B    |   C    |   x2    |     |
| A    |   C    |   x3    |     |
| B    |   N    |   x4    |     |
| C    |   N    |   x3    |     |
| N    |   Z    |   x5    |     |
| ...  |  ...   |   ...   | ... |

**forced_redirection** refers to redirection from source location (can be town or camp) to destination location (mainly camp) and source location indicated as forwarding_hub. The value of `0` indicates no redirection, `1` indicates redirection (from name2) to name1 and 2 corresponds to redirection (from name1) to name2.


## **Define location and border closures in closures.csv file**

We identify location or border closure events and document them in **closures.csv** file:

| **closure_type** | **name1** | **name2** | **closure_start = 0** | **closure_end = -1** |
|:----:|:------:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|
| location | A  | B |  xxx | xxx |
| country | ABC  | ZZZ |  xxx | xxx |
| ...  | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**closure_type** has 2 possible values:

* **location** corresponding to camp or town closure and
* **country** referring to border closure.

**closure_start** and **closure_end** are given as integers, counting the number of days after the simulation start. The value of `0` indicates the start, while `-1` indicates the end of the simulation.

## **Define a conflict period for a conflict situation**

We define the simulation period of a conflict situation using **conflict_period.csv** file, which has the following format:

| **StartDate** | **YYYY-MM-DD** |
|:----:|:------:|
| Length | simulation_period  |


## **Record conflict locations in conflicts.csv file**

We create a **conflicts.csv** file to record conflict locations indicating the start of conflicts in the simulation execution (represented as `1`):

| **#Day** | **name** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **Z** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## **Construct a network map for a conflict situation**

Construct an agent-based network map from locations.csv and routes.csv using [https://carto.com](https://carto.com).

## **Construct validation data**

There are three CSV file formats required for validation of simulation outputs. CSV file containing total forced migrant counts **refugees.csv** comprises total counts of forcibly displaced people from `Refugees and asylum-seekers from 'chosen situation name' - Total` JSON file and has the format as demonstrated:

| ... | ... |
|:---:|:---:|
| YYYY-MM-DD | xxx |
| YYYY-MM-DD | xxx |
| ... | ... |

We obtain data for each camp using the format and label them as **country_name-camp_name.csv**:

| ... | ... |
|:---:|:---:|
| YYYY-MM-DD | xxx |
| YYYY-MM-DD | xxx |
| ... | ... |

**data_layout.csv** contains camp names for each camp/destination locations:

| total | refugees.csv |
|:---:|:---:|
| camp_name1 | country_name-camp_name1.csv |
| camp_name2 | country_name-camp_name2.csv |
| ... | ... |
